# AWS-S3_Bucket-Operation-using-PHP-and-AWS-SDK-S3-client
I am integrating Amazon Cloud storage services S3 Bucket ( AWS cloud repository ) to my local hosted webpage using PHP scripts.


You need a composer package for mac which can be installed from here : https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

You need composer.json and autoload.php file for Amazon S3 Client .

This script creates / deletes / lists files and folders in the remote cloud S3 Bucket .

You can use absolute / relative paths for files and folders of your choice.
